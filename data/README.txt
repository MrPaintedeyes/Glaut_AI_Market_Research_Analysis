# Note about synthetic dataset

Please note that the actual responses from surveys and interviews are not included in the repository due to privacy and confidentiality agreements. 
In particular, we can't disclosure users' demographic information (geographic area, age, sex, city size)
Synthetic data is provided for testing and demonstration purposes. In the synthetic data, the same sample proportions are preserved. 
However, we included all the real experimental data that didn't expose any of the users' personal information (UX rating, number of themes, number of words etc.)
