# Glaut_AI_Market_Research_Analysis

This repository contains modules and scripts used for the analysis of data collected in a market research project utilizing Glaut's AI-native market research software and a globally known survey builder.
The project compares the performance of an AI conversational agent with traditional static surveys in extracting qualitative insights at scale.
This repository contains scripts to assess and visualize whether the means of specific variables are different when conditioned by categorical variables. Plus, we present the script used to automatically annotate (and classify) data with categorical levels through an instructed LLM. It is also included a synthetic dataset that resembles the original data distributions for the demographic variables, and contains the real experimental data when it didn't expose any personal information about users (Number of themes, number of words, User Experience Rating).
